An introduction to NUnit and unit testing

# Why Unit Testing is critical

1. Catch Issues Early:
Unit tests validate the smallest parts of your application—each function or method—ensuring that they work correctly before you integrate them into the larger system. This means that when changes are made, errors are caught early in the development cycle rather than surfacing as bugs in production.

2. Facilitate Refactoring:
Having a comprehensive suite of unit tests gives you confidence to refactor or improve your code. When you change your code, running your tests immediately shows if something broke, so you can fix it before it becomes a larger issue.

3. Serve as Living Documentation:
Unit tests provide clear examples of how your code is supposed to behave. They act as documentation, explaining the intended functionality of your methods. This is especially useful for graduate developers who are still learning the best practices.

4. Encourage Modularity:
Writing unit tests forces you to design your code in smaller, independent units that are easier to test and maintain. This leads to a more modular and clean codebase.

5. Support Continuous Integration:
Automated unit tests can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline, so every build and every merge triggers a test run. This keeps your codebase stable and reduces the risk of introducing defects.
